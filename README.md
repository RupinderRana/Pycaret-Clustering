# Pycaret-Clustering

## Project Introduction:
This project aims to explore clustering techniques on the Wine dataset using different algorithms and preprocessing methods. Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning that groups similar data points together based on certain features.

## Load Wine Dataset:
Load the Wine dataset using scikit-learn's load_wine function.

## Define Clustering Algorithms:
Define KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithms.

## Specify Preprocessing Approaches:
Create a dictionary of preprocessing approaches, including normalization, transformation, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Initialize DataFrames to store results for each algorithm and preprocessing combination.
Perform Clustering and Evaluation: For each combination of preprocessing and cluster configurations: Fit KMeans, Hierarchical, and birch models. Evaluate clustering quality using silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz score, and Davies-Bouldin score. Update the respective DataFrames with evaluation results.
